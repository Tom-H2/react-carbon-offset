This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Overview and Acknowledgements
This React App is the work of the Explorer Class at Five Acre School. It is designed to showcase each student's "Animal Card" of an animal the student has identified while working in the school wetland during the spring of 2019.

The goal will be to have each student's "Animal Card" appear when clicked on in the ViewDrawer. The "Northern Harrier" file in the Animal-Cards folder is an example and a placeholder at this point.

### Instructions to open Countering Carbon
The project repo can be accessed at [GitHub](https://github.com/Tom-H2/FEND-my-app-countering-carbon.git)

- From the GitHub repo page clone/download repo and select download
- That action puts a copy of the repo in the computer's download folder
- Move that zipped folder from download to a C:// folder and unzipped (extract all)
- In a terminal window navigate to the file location of unzipped folder
- Entered "npm install react"
- After that is complete, entered "npm start"
- A new browser window opens program running at location [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Service Worker
- ServiceWorker, included in the index.js file is used in production build only.
To optimize Countering Carbon:
  1. Run: `npm run build`
  2. Deploy: `npm run deploy` to deploy to the address specified  
- `npm run serve`
- Local host 5000

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
